# Intro to React

_This project is a fork of [She Codes Now's Intro to React](https://github.com/She-Codes-Now/Intro-to-React)._

## Getting started
Welcome! This codebase was developed to serve as the working code for an intro to React class for Philly Tech Sistas. If you found yourself here and want to follow along on your own, check out the [slides for the class](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wf_RYiWEEyooNDyZXP6uA8v2BORfmeL2xXavHAALb4E/edit#slide=id.g524bca57f8_1_140)!

To get started exposing the app on your localhost to be rendered on your browser, follow these steps:
1. Verify that you have npm installed, this command should print the version of `npm`:
```bash
npm -v
```
If you see any errors, you might need to install npm (if you're using a Mac, try `brew install npm`).

2. Once you have `npm` good to go, run the following commands to get the server code up and running:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

3. You'll notice that the output of the console shows your the URL that you can use to view your website in the browser with. In my case, that is `http://localhost:3000/`, but check your console output to make sure you get the correct port!
